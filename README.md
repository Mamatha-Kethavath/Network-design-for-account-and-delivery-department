Network Design for Accounts and Delivery Department üåêüíº

1.The Network Design for Accounts and Delivery Department project aims to create a robust and efficient network infrastructure that facilitates seamless communication and 
  data sharing between the Accounts and Delivery departments within an organization.
2.This design focuses on enhancing operational efficiency while ensuring security and scalability.


üöÄ Features

1.Department Connectivity: Establishes a reliable connection between the Accounts and Delivery departments using a secure Local Area Network (LAN).
2.IP Addressing Plan: Implements a structured IP addressing scheme to ensure organized network management.
3.Centralized File Storage: Enables real-time data sharing and collaboration through centralized storage solutions.
4.Unified Communication Tools: Integrates VoIP, instant messaging, and video conferencing for effective interaction.
5.Advanced Security Measures: Incorporates firewalls, encryption, and access controls to protect sensitive data.
6.Scalability: Modular design allows for future growth and integration of additional departments.


üõ† Tools and Technologies

1.Network Devices: Routers, switches, and PCs for hardware setup.
2.IP Addressing: Utilizes the 192.168.40.0/24 subnet for network configuration.
3.Network Simulation: Cisco Packet Tracer for designing and testing the network.
4.Documentation: Markdown for project documentation and reporting.


üß† Methodology

1.Requirements Analysis: Identifying functional and non-functional requirements for the network.
